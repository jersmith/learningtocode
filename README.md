# Setup<a name="setup"></a>
I believe an introduction to coding should be based on concepts, not language details, so in many ways the choice of language is secondary. But in order to understand concepts, you need to implement them in *some* language, and for many reasons I won't express here, I've chosen Python. We'll focus on concepts, but use Python to express those concepts. You can then apply these concepts to additional languages at your leisure.

## Editor<a name="editor"></a>
For any coding, you'll need an editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), note that this is not the same as Visual Studio. It runs on Windows, Mac or Linux, has excellent documentation, and a rich ecosystem of addons/plugins so you can tailor it for most languages. This is your primary weapon, and you will spend a lot of time in it. So it pays to take time to learn how it works, create some files, delete some files, play with the themes/search, etc. You'll use this a lot, so pin it to the taskbar.

## Language<a name="language"></a>
Of course you'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure when you install on Windows you allow it to overwrite your path so you can run it from anywhere. While you're downloading it from the python.org site, take a look around. There is a lot of documentation there that will be useful later.

## Shell<a name="shell"></a>
We run Python programs by using the `python` command in a shell. Every OS has one; on Windows you have a few choices. There is the old DOS shell called *cmd* and a much better, more recent shell, called *PowerShell*. A good reason for using PowerShell is that many of the commands that work in other shells (say for Mac, Linux or even DOS) work in PowerShell. You can find PowerShell in the Start menu, under *Windows PowerShell*. Pin this to the taskbar.

## Source Control<a name="sourcecontrol"></a>
You are reading this on GitHub, which is a good way to learn about source control.
